        Studio Ghibli’s Origins

          Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao
          Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, but Miyazaki and Takahata have a
          relationship that far predates this. The pair first worked together in
          1964, marking the beginning of a collaborative relationship that would
          carry on throughout their careers. They had both worked on numerous
          Japanese movies and television shows up until 1984, when Nausicaä of
          the Valley of the Wind, the first original feature film that Hayao
          Miyazaki directed, became both a box office and critical success.
          While Nausicaä isn’t an actual Studio Ghibli production, it is
          unmistakably Miyazaki and displays some of the hallmarks that partly
          define his style. It conveys a strong pro-environmental message and
          has a heroine at the center of the story, both things that he comes
          back to throughout his future films. Toshio Suzuki was part of the
          production team on Nausicaä. Buoyed by the film’s performance,

          Miyazaki and Suzuki decided to set up their own studio and invited
          Takahata to join them. Tokuma-Shoten, the Tokyo-based publishing
          company, provided the necessary funding to found Studio Ghibli, and so
          a journey was started that would result in 21 feature films and a
          reputation as one of the world’s best animation studios. Putting it
          like this makes it sound like it was a straight line to success, but
          it wasn’t quite that straightforward.

        But Just Who or What is a Ghibli?

          The name Ghibli was chosen by Miyazaki. The word ghibli’s root is
          Italian and it’s based on the Libyan term for ‘hot desert wind’, with
          the concept being that the new studio was going blow a new wind
          through the animation industry. A name with this meaning might have
          seemed a tad lofty and ambitious, yet it wasn’t long before the studio
          was making good on its promise, shaking up not only the world of
          animation but also the wider film industry.

          The studio’s first film, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, was released in
          1986 and went on to become Japan’s highest-grossing animation film
          that year. It included some familiar motifs that are definitive of
          Miyazaki’s style, such as his obsession with the mechanics of flight
          and a penchant for magical realism. His father was an aeronautical
          engineer who ran the family business, Miyazaki airlines. This
          influence permeates so much of the younger Miyazaki’s output, and
          Laputa is one of the clearest examples. Much of the film’s action
          takes place in the air, with airships and flying devices featuring
          heavily.

        From Commercial Flop to Cult Classic

        <p className='lg:p-10 md:p-6 sm:p-8 grid pt-4 text-sm md:text-base lg:text-md  '>
          In 1988, Studio Ghibli followed up Laputa: Castle in the Sky by
          releasing two films simultaneously—the Takahata-directed Grave of the
          Fireflies and Miyazaki’s My Neighbor Totoro. This simultaneous release
          was needed to boost the studio’s financial status, but on its release,
          My Neighbor Totoro was something of a commercial flop. Luckily, the
          film’s merchandise sold well. More interestingly, My Neighbor Totoro
          went on to become a cult classic and is now regarded as one of the
          studio’s most beloved films. The main character, Totoro, is even
          featured on the Studio Ghibli logo. The next year heralded something
          of a breakthrough for the studio. After acquiring the rights for a
          film adaptation of the novel Kiki's Delivery Service the movie went
          through a challenging production process before being released in July
          1989. The hand-painted scenery of Kiki's Delivery Service is a joy to
          behold, and like many of Studio Ghibli’s movies, it features a strong
          female as the lead protagonist in a coming-of-age story. It was a
          runaway success and became Japan’s highest-grossing movie of 1989.

        Going Global

          For the guts of the next decade, Studio Ghibli continued to produce
          successful animated films, such as Porco Rosso and Whisper of the
          Heart, but their popularity remained largely confined to Japan.
          ‍Princess Mononoke changed that. Set in the late Muromachi period, the
          film once again revisited Miyazaki’s recurrent theme of the
          environment. It examined the tension that is experienced between
          humanity’s need for growth and nature’s need for preservation, as well
          as exploring other themes such as disability and sexuality. Tackling
          these large themes in films that are also accessible by children is a
          hallmark of Studio Ghibli and something that sets the animation house
          apart from much of the industry. Miyazaki also incorporated new
          production techniques on Princess Mononoke, utilizing computer
          animation, 3D rendering, texture mapping, and digital composition. The
          film ended up being the most expensive Studio Ghibli production to
          date, but the investment paid off in spades. Released in 1997,
          Princess Mononoke was a box office smash, becoming not only Japan’s
          highest-grossing film of the year, but Japan’s highest-grossing film
          of all time, an accolade it held until 2001 when it was toppled by
          another Studio Ghibli production, Spirited Away. Princess Mononoke was
          not only a commercial success, but a huge critical one too. The film
          won the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, becoming the
          first-ever animated film to receive this award. In 1999, Princess
          Mononoke was released in the U.S. with distribution by Miramax. It
          performed poorly at the box office, but went on to sell well on DVD
          and video. Studio Ghibli had taken its first big step onto the world
          stage.

          While it could be said that Princess Mononoke was only a modest
          success in North America, it showed that Studio Ghibli’s films could
          travel and opened a door to the future. Yet if it wasn’t for the
          studio’s strength of conviction, that door might have remained shut
          forever. In the mid-1980s, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was
          repackaged for the United States as Warriors of the Wind. It wasn’t
          just the name that was changed – the film underwent heavy edits in
          order to market it as a children’s action-adventure movie. In total,
          22 minutes of footage were cut, messing up the narrative meaning and
          changing the way some characters were portrayed. As a response to this
          catastrophe, Miyazaki famously adopted a strict ‘no edits’ policy for
          all future adaptations. The now-disgraced movie executive and then
          head of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein, wanted to directly challenge
          Miyazaki on his policy and edit Princess Mononoke to make it, in his
          opinion, more marketable for a U.S. audience. Producer Toshio Suzuki
          was having absolutely none of it. He sent Weinstein an authentic
          katana samurai sword accompanied by the succinct message ‘no cuts’.
          Studio Ghibli got its way, and no edits were made.

          If Princess Mononoke could be said to have opened the door to
          international success, 2001’s Spirited Away blew the door off its
          hinges. Conceived by Miyazaki as a film aimed at 10-year-old girls,
          catering to what they “held dear in their hearts" and not to more
          trivial things like romance and who they have a crush on. Instead,
          Miyazaki once again puts a strong female at the center of the
          celebrated film, intending to create a character that girls could
          really look up to. Computer animation was once again utilized to
          create the film, but not in a way that overshadowed the story and
          production. Released in Japan in July 2001, Spirited Away was a
          colossal success. It became the highest-grossing Japanese film of all
          time, a stature that it held for the next 19 years. As with Princess
          Mononoke, Spirited Away won the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the
          Year, but perhaps more impressive than this is the international
          acclaim that it received – it won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature
          (and is the only non-English-language and hand-drawn anime film to
          ever do so, cementing its place in film history) and the Golden Bear
          prize at the Berlin International Film Festival. Spirited Away is
          rightly regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time,
          and one of the best films of the 21st century. It cemented Studio
          Ghibli’s reputation as a world-leading animation house and confirmed
          Miyazaki’s immense talents as a universal storyteller and artist.

          Studio Ghibli continued to produce successful and highly regarded
          films in the subsequent years, including Howl’s Moving Castle, Ponyo,
          and The Wind Rises. The business also underwent a number of changes,
          including mergers, deals with Disney, and most recently an arrival of
          the Studio Ghibli catalog on various streaming platforms. The
          streaming news was big for a number of reasons. Firstly, the studio
          had been quite resistant to a move to streaming, believing that the
          theaters should come first, so it’s a big deal that Studio Ghibli
          movies are now available on platforms like Netflix and HBO Max.
          Secondly, it means that a whole new audience and generation of fans
          are able to dive into the rich, wonderful world of Ghibli. With the
          retirement of Miyazaki in 2014, the studio was placed on a temporary
          hiatus. However, you can’t keep a good man down, and just a few years
          later in 2017, Miyazaki came out of retirement again to announce that
          he was directing another feature film, How Do You Live?. He has stated
          that this will be his last film, and it is due for release in 2023. On
          its return, the studio also produced an adaptation of the novel Earwig
          and the Witch by Diana Wynne Jones om 2020. Looking back over the
          history of Studio Ghibli, it’s hard to overstate just how much of an
          impact it had on the world of animation. The studio brought the art of
          film to new heights and introduced generations to its intricate worlds
          and captivating stories.
